# Hapi Email

Send ***welcome, verification, notification and reminder emails***
from *any* Hapi.js app.


## Why?

While we would *prefer* for *email* to be *phased out*
and replaced by something *better*, the fact remains
that *most* people still use email as their *primary*
means of (*digital*) communication.

Given that email is not going away, we need to make
sending email to people as ***simple and reliable*** as possible.

## What?

*Reliably* ***Send*** `html` **email** with ***dependable delivery***.  
When email that *has* to get through as quickly as possible
so everyone can get on with their lives.

## *How*?

### Install `hapi-email` from NPM

```sh
npm install hapi-email --save
```

### Mandril API Key *Environment Variable*

*securely* store your Mandril API Key.

> ***quick introduction***: https://github.com/dwyl/learn-environment-variables

## Want *Examples*?

There are *many* situations where you want to send people email.

### *Welcome* Email!

A simple "hello & welcome to our community" email
you send to people when they register to learn more about
your product/service.


### *Verify* Email Address

As part of registering new people for your Hapi app you
will need to *verify* their email addresses to ensure that people
are not signing up with *fake* emails (or *worse* using someone else's email!)

### *Reminder* Email?

Remind people they signed up but have not *used* the product/service?


## *Notes*?
